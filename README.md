# ASR-1-bit-Qwen

English streaming ASR with near-binary weight quantization (`{-1,+1}` target,
ternary fallback), built **only** from Qwen models and targeting R2T2-class
published streaming quality on CPU/edge.

- **Plan of record:** [`docs/PLANNING.md`](docs/PLANNING.md)
- **Base models (Apache-2.0):**
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B`
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B`
  - `Qwen/Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B`
- **Scope:** English only, research use, no distribution.
- **No R2T2 weights/code are used** — R2T2 is referenced as a benchmark target only.
